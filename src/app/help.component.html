  <div class="card-block">
    In <span class="dc">Data Commandr</span>, data is organized into many tables which are displayed in the TABLES panel as a list. 
    Each table must have a unique name. However, tables do not have their own defintions, that is, new tables do not result from operations with other tables like in the conventional (set-oriented) approaches.

  <div class="card-block">
    <p>All columns of the selected tables are displayed in the COLUMNS panel. Each column must have a unique name within its table. 
    A column is characterized by its type. Column types is either a primitive type or another column.
    Real data values that a column stores can be either uploaded or computed from other columns.

    <h6 class="card-title text-xs-center"><b>COLUMN FORMULAS</b></h6>
  </div>
  <div class="card-block">
    <p><span class="dc">Data Commandr</span> uses a column-oriented approach to data representation and processing. 
    This means that a new column can be defined in terms of other columns and hence data a column stores is derived from the data in other columns.
    </p>
    <p>Column formulas are a primary element of <span class="dc">Data Commandr</span> because they determine how the data will be processed.
    Column formulas in this sense are analogous to traditional data queries. 
    Column type determines how column values are computed. Currently there exist four column types:</p>
    <ul> 
    <li>User columns get their data values from outside, for example, using import from CSV</li>
    <li>Calculated columns compute a primitive value from other values in the current row or values in linked row using an expression.</li>
    <li>Accumulated (or aggregated) columns are intended for data aggregation and they compute their value from many rows of another table using an accumulate expression.</li> 
    <li>Link columns has a value which references a row in another table (which is its data type).</li>
    </ul> 

    <p class="card-title text-xs-center"><b>Calculated Columns</b></p>

    <p>Primitive column formula is an expression which is composed of other column names and operations.  
    Column names used in formulas must be written in square brackets. 
    For example, if we want to compute the sum of two existing columns then the (third) column formula has to be defined as follows: <code>[Column 1] + [Column 2]</code>
    </p>

    <p>Column formulas can use the following operators: 
    addition <code>2+2</code>, subtraction <code>2-2</code>, multiplication <code>2*2</code>, division <code>2/2</code>, 
    exponential <code>2^2</code>, unary minus or plus <code>+2-(-2)</code>, modulo <code>2%2</code>.
    </p>

    <p>Column formulas can use the following functions: 
    <code>abs</code>, <code>acos</code>, <code>asin</code>, <code>atan</code>, <code>cbrt</code>, <code>ceil</code>, 
    <code>cos</code>, <code>cosh</code>, <code>exp</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>log</code>, <code>log2</code>, <code>log10</code>, 
    <code>sin</code>, <code>sinh</code>, <code>sqrt</code>, <code>tan</code>, <code>tanh</code>, <code>signum</code>. 
    </p>

    <p class="card-title text-xs-center"><b>Accumulated Columns</b></p>

    <p>Accumulated formulas use the main expression to initialize its values precisely as it is done for primitive expressions.
    If the main expression is empty then a default value will be used for initialization.</p>

    <p>In addition, this initial value is updated by specifying three additional parameters.</p>
    <ul> 
    <li><b>Accumulate table</b> It is necessary to specify another table the rows of which will be accumulated.</li>
    <li><b>Accumulate path</b> A column path has to be specified that leads from the chosen accumulate table to this table.</li>
    <li><b>Accumulate formula</b> This formula is written in terms of the accumulate table. Its purpose is to update this column using values from the accumulate table. 
      This formula has to use an additional parameter <code>[out]</code> which is equal to the current value of the column.
      </li> 
    </ul> 

    <p class="card-title text-xs-center"><b>Link Columns</b></p>

    <p>Link formulas have special syntax. They are enclosed in curly brackets and store a comma separated list of assignments: 
      <code>&#123; [Col1] = PRIMITIVE EXPRESSION 1, [Col1] = PRIMITIVE EXPRESSION 2, ... &#125;</code>.
      Each element of this list is an assignment consisting of two expressions. 
      The left hand part is some column of the type table of this column.
      The right hand part is an expression written using columns of this table.

    <h6 class="card-title text-xs-center"><b>EVALUATING AND DISPLAYING DATA</b></h6>
  </div>
  <div class="card-block">
    When a formula is defined or modified then it is not immediately evaluated and the column data is not updated. 
    To evaluate formulas it is necessary to press the Evaluate button and then the (up-to-date) data of the currently selected table has to be loaded by pressing the Load button.
    The result is then shown as a number of rows where values have been either previously uploaded or computed from other columns.

    <h6 class="card-title text-xs-center"><b>UPLOADING DATA</b></h6>
  </div>
  <div class="card-block">
    Columns whithout a formula get their data from outside by uploading it to the selected table. 
    Currently <span class="dc">Data Commandr</span> supports import from CSV format. 
    This means that the first row of the text has to be a list of column names, for example, <code>Column 1, Column 2</code>. 
    All other rows store values for these columns, for example, the second row could contain the following two values: <code>22.22, 33.33</code>.
